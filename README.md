## 🕹️ How to Play the Game

### 1. **Download the Executable**

Due to GitHub’s file size limitations, the game executable is **not included in this repository**.

**Download the latest build here:**  
[Download NovaPeakGame (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GPkvVksrhhUvw9oIekEiM9tFdVMkJUkr?usp=sharing)

> _The executable and all necessary files are provided in a ZIP file. Just extract and run `NovaPeakGame.exe`._

### 2. **Why isn’t the executable in this repository?**

- GitHub restricts files larger than 100 MB, and the game build exceeds this limit.
- To keep the repository clean and focused on source code, the build is distributed via Google Drive.
